# Vizio Always On
 
 My Vizio sound bar repeatedly was turning itself off while in use. I made this script to run on a server at my house via cron job to make sure the sound bar never turns off for more than a few minutes. 
 
 `Vizio-Always-On` is based off of [`homebridge-vizio-soundbar`] and uses [`vizio-smart-cast`](https://github.com/heathbar/vizio-smart-cast/blob/master/README.md) by [Heath Paddock](https://github.com/heathbar).
